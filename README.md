# exercise-logger

v1.0.0: All basic functionality in place. User can create an account then log in, then view, add, edit and delete activity log items unique to their account.

To improve:

- Add "Nothing to show" dialog when filtering returns no results

- Add animation to activity items - they currently immediately appear and disappear

- Add remaining CRUD operations to user database - allow users to edit and delete their account
